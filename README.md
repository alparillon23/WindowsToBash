# WindowsToBash
Simple Applet to Convert Windows paths into Bash (Ubuntu) paths for Ubuntu for Windows and WSL

- In CMD, compile the WindowsToBash.java file and insert the source when prompted.
- You will then receive the Bash equivalent of the Windows directory
- Just copy the <b>link</b> (including the ") and use in bash as
  - <i>cd <b>link</b> </i> (pasting in shell is done with right-click in Windows)
- You will be sent to this directory to deal with the files there

I have found this useful in my networking course because I use Ubuntu for Windows and there is no means to quick convert the link
when I need specific file access (while not disrupting my directory organization). This makes it easy to navigate directories in bash
while using a Windows operating system.
